# To-Do List Application

A simple To-Do list application that allows users to add, complete, delete, and organize tasks based on their status. This project is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** for the backend, and plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Data is stored in-memory on the server.

## Features
